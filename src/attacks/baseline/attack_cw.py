    Distance Measure : L2

    Arguments:
        model (nn.Module): model to attack.
        c (float): c in the paper. parameter for box-constraint. (Default: 1)
            :math:`minimize \Vert\frac{1}{2}(tanh(w)+1)-x\Vert^2_2+c\cdot f(\frac{1}{2}(tanh(w)+1))`
        kappa (float): kappa (also written as 'confidence') in the paper. (Default: 0)
            :math:`f(x')=max(max\{Z(x')_i:i\neq t\} -Z(x')_t, - \kappa)`
        steps (int): number of steps. (Default: 100)
        lr (float): learning rate of the Adam optimizer. (Default: 0.01)

    Shape:
        - images: :math:`(N, C, H, W)` normalized images with ImageNet mean/std
        - labels: :math:`(N)` where each value :math:`y_i` is :math:`0 \leq y_i \leq` `number of labels`.
        - output: :math:`(N, C, H, W)` normalized adversarial images.

    Examples::
        >>> attack = CW(model, c=1, kappa=0, steps=100, lr=0.01)
        >>> adv_images = attack(images, labels)

    Note:
        This implementation works with normalized inputs. The tanh transformation
        is adjusted to properly map between normalized space and optimization space.
